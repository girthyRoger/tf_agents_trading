# Planning for trading env 2

## TODO
- 02/05: implement a test for the new trading env. See if I can find an easy pyplot candlestick chart render. 

## Ideas
- Implement a LTSM model. 
- Implement a Liquid NN.
- Try some unsupervised learning on the yfinance dataset and train models on the groups rather than all stocks.
